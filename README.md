# Personal C Sandbox

This repository is a personal storage area for small C programs and data structure / algorithm practice.
Each file is a standalone example; many are quick experiments rather than polished libraries.

Build and run (example):
```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o program file.c
./program
```

Notes:
- Files may be in different styles depending on when they were written.
- Some programs use input files (e.g., maze text files) that live alongside the sources.
